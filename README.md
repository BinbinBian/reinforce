#reinforce

A 'plug and play' reinforcement learning library in Python.

Infers a Markov Decision Process from data and solves for the optimal policy.

Implementation based on Andrew Ng's <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes12.pdf">notes.</a>

##Motivation

<a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> provides excellent tools for supervised and unsupervised learning but explicitly does not deal with reinforcement learning.

reinforce is intended to compliment the functionality of scikit-learn and together form a more complete machine learning toolkit.
